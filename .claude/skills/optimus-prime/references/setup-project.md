# Full Project Setup Workflow

Default workflow for both fresh prime and re-prime. SKILL.md has the mode split, principles, and decision matrix; this file is the step-by-step.

## Step 1: Analyze the Repo and Existing Config

Explore the codebase deeply. The goal is to understand what makes this project unique — what conventions, patterns, and constraints Claude needs to know to work well here.

Summarize:

- stack, package manager, workspace shape, major app boundaries
- test/lint/typecheck commands actually used
- conventions, patterns, and project-specific utilities
- existing docs worth referencing from `CLAUDE.md`
- existing Claude config that should be preserved, refined, or removed

Use [analysis-checklist.md](../references/analysis-checklist.md) for non-obvious inspection targets.

## Step 2: Present the Discussion Summary

Before changing meaningful files, report back using the Output Format from SKILL.md (Current State / Proposed Changes / Files to Touch, plus Decisions and Risks when non-empty).

Analysis is safe to run immediately. Overwrites, deletions, or wholesale regeneration require user confirmation.

## Step 3: Create Project Skills

Skills are the foundation. Everything else depends on having the right domain knowledge in place.

Review existing `.claude/skills/` first. Prefer refining strong project skills over creating new ones.

For each skill the project needs:

1. **Identify the gap** — what domain knowledge is missing or weak?
2. **Check starters** — does `.claude/starter-skills/` have reference material for this domain? If so, pass it as input to skill-creator.
3. **Run `/skill-creator`** — every skill must be created through skill-creator. This ensures quality, proper structure, and project-specific fit (CREATE skill only - don't optimize it this phase)

Starters are reference material that accelerate skill-creator — they are not standalone templates to copy into the project. A starter for "frontend-development" doesn't mean the project gets a generic frontend skill; it means skill-creator has a head start when building a skill fitted to this project's specific frontend stack and patterns.

**Gate:** important frameworks and domains should have skill coverage before you move on to rules or CLAUDE.md.

## Step 4: Identify Path-Scoped Rules (if any)

Rules are optional. Zero rules is a valid outcome.

Rule test:

> With the relevant skill activated, will code still be wrong without this information?

- **Yes** → path-scoped `.claude/rules/<name>.md` with `paths:`
- **No** → skill, CLAUDE.md, or on-demand reference

Red flags — something is **not** a rule:

- it applies broadly to a language or framework rather than this repo
- a reusable skill should already teach it
- it is informative context, not a correctness guardrail

Do not modify `_apply-all.md`. It is a universal boilerplate rule from prime, not project config.

**Gate:** review proposed rules with the user before creating them.

## Step 5: Generate or Refine CLAUDE.md

CLAUDE.md is always-on context — every token competes for attention. Keep it lean and high-signal.

Priorities:

- identity, commands, stack summary — concise
- key architecture decisions that affect most tasks
- pointers to existing docs, READMEs, and on-demand references
- do not duplicate what skills already teach
- do not mention rules (they auto-attach)
- prefer refining a good existing CLAUDE.md over regenerating it

If existing docs are too verbose for agents, an optional `.claude/project/` reference layer can hold dense, agent-oriented references.

## Step 6: Offer CLAUDE.local.md Setup

Ask whether the user wants personal, gitignored preferences — role, sandbox URLs, preferred test data, workflow quirks. If yes, create or refine `CLAUDE.local.md` and ensure `.gitignore` covers it.

## Step 7: Domain Documentation (only if it adds value)

If important business logic is undocumented, use `/create-doc` to populate `docs/` with durable explanations — business rules, domain concepts, workflows, state machines. Reference these from CLAUDE.md rather than duplicating them into always-on context.

## Step 8: Clean Up Carefully

Cleanup targets:

1. `.claude/starter-skills/` after starters have been used as reference
2. skills that clearly do not fit the target repo
3. obsolete Claude config being intentionally replaced

### Protected skills (never delete during priming)

Keep these regardless of stack — they are workflow, meta, or universal utility skills:

- **Workflow:** `cook`, `fix`, `test`, `review-code`, `ask`, `discuss`, `give-plan`, `create-doc`, `diagnose`
- **Meta / tooling:** `optimus-prime`, `prime-sync`, `skill-creator`, `self-evolve`
- **Universal utilities:** `docs-seeker`, `media-processor`

Capability skills like `frontend-design` or `agent-browser` may be removed when the project clearly does not need them (e.g. `frontend-design` in a backend-only repo). When unsure, keep the skill and ask the user.

**Gate:** list proposed deletions and confirm before removing anything.

## Step 9: Verify

Spot-check:

- references in `CLAUDE.md` and skill tables point to real files
- skills are project-specific, not generic boilerplate
- stated stack and commands match repo evidence
- proposed rules actually pass the rule test
- `CLAUDE.md` stays compact enough to earn its always-on status

For ongoing config health checks, recommend `/self-evolve`.

## Step 10: Offer Skill Optimization

Everything is set up and working. Now offer the user two optimization paths for the skills that were created:

| Option                              | What it does                                                         | Pros                                                                                                                         | Cons                                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Description optimization only**   | Optimizes skill descriptions for highest invocation accuracy         | Fast, low cost                                                                                                               | Skills may have weak instructions that only surface during real use |
| **Full optimization (Recommended)** | Runs evals loop + self-improve iterations + description optimization | Skills are battle-tested before the user depends on them. Catches instruction gaps, wrong behaviors, and weak triggers early | Takes more time and tokens                                          |

**Recommend full optimization.** Skills the user will rely on daily deserve the investment — finding problems now is cheaper than hitting them mid-task later. Let the user choose either option or skip entirely.
